Mappasaurus is an AI-powered operating system with a bold vision. We leverage the power of artificial intelligence to process image data from various sources, including dashcams, smartphones, and potentially more in the future. We're starting our journey by revolutionizing map creation with the power of AI, decentralized storage, distributed computing, and blockchain/NFTs.

## 🌟 Features

- **Decentralized Data Collection**: Mappasaurus leverages a network of dashcams and mobile devices to capture video footage, which is then preprocessed to blur private information like human faces and vehicle number plates.

- **Decentralized Storage**: The processed video frames are streamed to decentralized storage like IPFS and BNB Greenfield, ensuring data integrity, transparency, and resilience.

- **Distributed Processing**: The video frames are processed on a decentralized architecture like FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine) for advanced analysis, including lane detection, signboard recognition, and traffic light identification.

- **Monetization and Incentives**: Mappasaurus offers a "tap and earn" app where users can contribute data and earn $cracka tokens and Dino NFTs, which can be redeemed for discounts on Mappasaurus dashcams.

- **Mapping Solution API**: The processed data is compiled into a mapping solution API, which is then sold to companies for various applications.

## 🏆 BNB Greenfield Hackathon Solutions

Mappasaurus addresses multiple challenges from the BNB Greenfield hackathon:

### 🤖 AI Track (Challenge 1: BNB Chain AI generated content platform)

We generate some of our Dino NFT cards using AI models and mint them on the opBNB chain, enabling the tokenization and monetization of AI-generated content.

### 🔗 DePin Track (Challenge 2: Blockchain of Things (BoT) on BNB Greenfield)

Our decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) of dashcams and mobile devices collects and sends video footage to be stored on BNB Greenfield's decentralized storage buckets, ensuring seamless data collection, enhanced security, and reliability.

### 🎮 Gaming Track (Challenge 3: opBNB on-chain game)

Our tap-to-earn Telegram app, where users can earn $cracka tokens and mint NFTs on the opBNB chain, serves as an on-chain game that utilizes the low-cost and high-performance transactions of the opBNB platform, increasing playability and attractiveness.

## 🦕 Technical Dino-Commands

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can unleash the following commands:

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

```bash
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode, ensuring our dino-code is battle-ready.

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimized for maximum performance.

```bash
npm run eject
```

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project, giving you full control over the build process, making you the alpha dino.
